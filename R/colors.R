#' An arctic, north-bluish color palette.
#' Created for the clean- and minimal flat design pattern to achieve a optimal focus and readability for code syntax highlighting and UI. It consists of four palettes utilzing a total of sixteen, carefully selected, dimmed pastel colors for a eye-comfortable, but yet colorful ambiance.
#'
#' The available palettes are:
#' polarnight
#' snowstorm
#' frost
#' aurora
#'
#' There are also two additional palettes derived from two northern classics:
#' lumina - a colour palette inspired by the Lumina Borealis event https://www.luminaborealis.com/
#' mountain - a colour palette inspired by the painting 'Mountain Forms' by Lawren Harris
